            <div class="drop-content">The software to be created for Chocoholics Anonymous provides data-processing facilities for the organization. All providers can bill ChocAn by filling member and respective service information in their terminals. The members receiving services are sent a member report, while the providers are sent provider reports at the end of the week. Managers, also, get a summary report. In addition, all three are given an opportunity to request their respective reports anytime. ChocAn data operators can add, delete, or update member and provider records. The software keeps a provider directory that stores all provider data. Our Use Case Diagram provides a simple representation of these tasks, which are explained in depth in our Use Case Descriptions. On our report, we have listed each team member contribution.  Glossary terms are also included to clarify the usage of terms used for the scope of this project.</div>
