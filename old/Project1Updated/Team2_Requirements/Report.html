            <div class="drop-content">Chocoholics Anonymous is an organization dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate in all its glorious forms. The software to be created for Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) provides data-processing facilities for the organization. All providers can bill ChocAn by filling in member and respective service information in their terminals. The members receiving services are sent a member report, while the providers are sent provider reports at the end of the week. Managers, also, get a summary report. In addition, all three are given an opportunity to request their respective reports anytime. ChocAn data operators can add, delete, or update member and provider records. The software keeps a provider directory that stores all provider data. Our Use Case Diagram provides a simple representation of these tasks, which are explained in depth in our Use Case Descriptions. In our report, we have listed each team member’s contribution. Glossary terms are also included to clarify the usage of terms used for the scope of this project. Our team has 6 members and our submitter is Jahanvi Kathiriya. Our project will use Java to implement all functionality.
